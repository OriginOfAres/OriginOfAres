## Hi there ⚔️

I am Aditya Partap Singh, I play Archery for India🇮🇳 & currently studying at IIIT Delhi👨🏻‍💻 where I am exploring the intersection of Data Science & Computational Biology in the domain of Health & Climate Change for Social Impact.

I love to build & fly model Airplanes✈️, next up is an Autonomous VTOL Jet. ⚛️

I am very passionate about Social Business and want to leverage it to solve social problems using Tech & Sports!
